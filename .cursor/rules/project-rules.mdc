LLMCMS – Agent Rules

# LLMCMS Agent Rules – Cursor Context

## GENERAL PRINCIPLES

1. This is a local-first CMS project called LLMCMS.
2. It uses `.lmdx` files (Markdown + JS + annotations) as the primary content source. These files follow a literate programming model and are used by developers and AI agents only.
3. The CMS runs entirely in the browser and must be installable as a PWA. Tauri or any other desktop wrapper is NOT permitted.
4. All AI functionality connects to a local Ollama instance via HTTP API. Do not use remote OpenAI APIs unless explicitly approved.
5. All styling MUST use native modern CSS. No frameworks are allowed. Use features like nesting, \:is(), \:not(), \:has(), and container queries. DO NOT use Tailwind, PicoCSS, Chakra, Bootstrap, or any UI framework.
6. The frontend uses Astro with React components mounted via Islands only where interactive functionality is needed.
7. All changes must be documented in a `/context/` folder as described below.

---

## FILE NAMING

* Code files must follow kebab-case or camelCase, depending on language conventions.
* Components go into `/src/components/`, utilities into `/src/utils/`, and AI tools into `/src/ai/`.

---

## FILE FORMATTING

* All code must follow Prettier rules:

  * `semi: false`
  * `useTabs: true`
  * `singleQuote: true`
* Use `const` and `let` – never `var`.
* In JSX, use ternary: `thing ? 'yes' : null`, avoid `thing && 'yes'`.
* Prefer function declarations over function expressions.
* Avoid deeply nested logic; extract into helpers when needed.

---

## CONTEXT LOGGING RULE

After each task, you MUST write a file in:

/context/\_\_.md

**Example:**

context/0003\_\_add-markdown-editor-component.md

---

## CONTEXT FILE STRUCTURE

Each context file must include:

```md
# [TASK-ID] – [Title in Sentence Case]

## Summary

Brief description of what was done.

## Files Created

- [path/to/file1.js]
- [path/to/file2.jsx]

## Reasoning

Explain why these changes were made. Reference any constraints from rules.

## AI Prompts Used

Summarize what type of prompt or logic was followed (optional, if applicable).
```

⸻

TASK COMMIT RULE

Every commit (or file write) must correspond to a single logical task or feature.

DO NOT batch unrelated changes in the same commit or context entry.

⸻

PERMITTED DEPENDENCIES

Only install libraries that are explicitly listed in cms.config.js. If unsure, request approval. Currently approved:
• milkdown
• remark, rehype
• idb
• jszip
• vite
• astro
• react

⸻

FILE TYPE CONVENTIONS

• `.lmdx`: Developer/AI files. Follow literate programming style. Include code + markdown + AI annotations. Never edited from the WYSIWYG interface.
• `.mdx`: Author-created content. Edited using the Markdown WYSIWYG editor. Rendered into HTML by Astro. Must not include literate annotations.

⸻

LMDX-SPECIFIC RULES

• Treat .lmdx files as MDX with special comments starting with \<!-- @.
• Parse and respect inline instructions like:
• @summarize, @rewrite, @generate-title
• If agent is modifying .lmdx content, annotate changes in the context file using diff-style:

* ## Old title

- ## New AI-enhanced title

⸻

FINAL EXPORT FORMAT

Every working version must support .zip export with this structure:

/content/*.mdx
/content/*.lmdx
/templates/astro-base/
netlify.toml (optional)

⸻

AI SAFEGUARDS
• Do not hardcode OpenAI API keys. Use local AI via Ollama unless instructed.
• Log all AI operations in the context file if they modify user content.

⸻

DEBUGGING AND TESTING
• If you’re unsure, save partial progress in context/ and exit cleanly.
• Never overwrite user content without confirmation logic.
