description: CSS Rules for LLMCMS
globs: 
alwaysApply: true
---

The LLMCMS project uses vanilla CSS or minimal frameworks only. TailwindCSS, Bootstrap, and utility-heavy frameworks are not allowed.
The CSS must be modern, semantic, and scoped to components when necessary.

Allowed
	•	CSS Nesting native
	•	:is() for selector grouping
	•	:not() for exclusion rules
	•	:has() for parent-child state logic (progressive enhancement only)
	•	:where() for unstyled grouping
	•	Container queries (@container) for responsive layout
	•	CSS custom properties (--var-name) defined in :root

 Conventions
	•	Styles for each component must be placed in either:
	•	A separate .css file with the same name as the component
	•	Or a global styles/ folder with clear separation
	•	Avoid global selectors unless targeting standard tags (body, html)
	•	Prefer BEM-style or scoped class naming if working in global styles

Not Allowed
	•	TailwindCSS, Chakra, Bootstrap, Bulma, Material UI
	•	Excessive specificity hacks
	•	Use of !important unless justified in context file
	•	Vendor-prefixed properties
