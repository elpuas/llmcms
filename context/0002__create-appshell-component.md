# 0002 â€“ Create AppShell Component Using Astro

## Summary

Created the main layout component `AppShell.astro` that provides a consistent shell for the LLMCMS application. The component features a header with the project title and a responsive two-column layout using CSS Grid with named slots for sidebar and content areas.

## Files Created

- [src/components/AppShell.astro]

## Reasoning

The AppShell component was built to satisfy the core layout requirements for LLMCMS:

1. **Header with project title**: Displays "LLMCMS" with subtitle "Local-First Content Management" 
2. **Sidebar and content slots**: Uses Astro's slot system with named slots (`sidebar` and `content`) for maximum flexibility
3. **Vanilla CSS styling**: Follows project rules - no frameworks, clean grid-based layout
4. **Responsive design**: Stacks sidebar above content on mobile devices (< 768px)
5. **Accessibility considerations**: Proper semantic HTML structure using `header`, `main`, `aside`, and `section` elements

The design uses CSS Grid for the main layout structure and includes proper overflow handling for scrollable content areas. Colors follow a professional blue/gray palette suitable for a developer-focused CMS tool.

## Technical Decisions

- **CSS Grid over Flexbox**: Chose Grid for more precise control over the two-dimensional layout
- **280px sidebar width**: Provides adequate space for navigation without overwhelming the content area  
- **Scoped styles**: Used Astro's built-in scoped styling to prevent CSS conflicts
- **System font stack**: Uses system-ui for better performance and native feel across platforms
